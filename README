# Plant Buddy

The primary goal of this project is to build something useful while learning
some embedded rust and something about the hardware used.

Plant buddy should be an embedded device that tracks some information about
plants like:

- temperature
- moisture level
- light exposure

In addition it should be able to communicate these information via some
connectivity to some smart home system or mobile app. Also it should be useful
without a smart home system by being able to display the information on the
device itself. In addition it should be capable of configuring some alerts that
notify a user that a plant needs some water.

Another aspect is that the device should somehow be not totally unsecure in his
communication capabilities.
